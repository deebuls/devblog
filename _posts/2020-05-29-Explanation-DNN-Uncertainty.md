title: Different types of uncertainty in DNN systems?

# What are the uncertainties in DNN?

This question is easily answered if you have read a little bit of DNN literature. The most popular answer is 
- Aleatoric uncertainty
- Epistemic uncertainty

An additional statement is always added to these different types of uncertainty which will claim that 
- Aleatoric uncertatinty is model uncertainty
- Epistemic uncertatinty is data uncertainty

But what actually are these values and what do they explain ? Lets do a brief overview of different literature to answer these questions.


# Alternative definitions
>> "Aleatory uncertainty is also referred to in the literature as variability, irreducible uncertainty, inherent uncertainty, and stochastic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is also termed reducible uncertainty, subjective uncertainty, and state-of-knowledge uncertainty." [2]
