I'm a researcher at the [Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology (b-it)](http://www.b-it-center.de/about-b-it/b-it-research-school/)
at the [Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) group in Bonn, Germany.

My research focus is on developing strategies for safe and reliable incorporation of deep learning methods into robotics.

I am also the lead develper with the [b-it-bots](https://mas-group.inf.h-brs.de/?page_id=643) team which won the RoboCup WorldCup and GermanOpen in the work league.

This paper presents the approach of our team, b-it-bots, in the RoboCup@Work competition which resulted in us winning the World Championship in Sydney in 2019. We describe our current hardware, including modifications made to the KUKA youBot, the underlying software framework and components developed for navigation, manipulation, perception and task planning for scenarios in industrial environments. Our combined 2D and 3D approach for object recognition has improved robustness and performance compared to previous years, and our task planning framework has moved us away from large state machines for high-level control. Future work includes closing the perception-manipulation loop for more robust grasping. Our open-source repository is available at https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_industrial_robotics.

##### [Performance  Evaluation  of  Low-Cost  Machine  Vision  Cameras  forImage-Based  Grasp  Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10167)
###### Performance  Evaluation  of  Low-Cost  Machine  Vision  Cameras  forImage-Based  Grasp  Verification
###### Under review in IROS 2020
Grasp    verification    is    advantageous    for    au-tonomous  manipulation  robots  as  they  provide  the  feedbackrequired for higher level planning components about successfultask  completion.  However,  a  major  obstacle  in  doing  graspverification is sensor selection. In this paper, we propose a visionbased grasp verification system using machine vision cameras,with  the  verification  problem  formulated  as  an  image  classifi-cation  task.  Machine  vision  cameras  consist  of  a  camera  anda processing unit capable of on-board deep learning inference.The  inference  in  these  low-power  hardware  are  done  near  thedata  source,  reducing  the  robots  dependence  on  a  centralizedserver,  leading  to  reduced  latency,  and  improved  reliability.Machine  vision  cameras  provide  the  deep  learning  inferencecapabilities  using  different  neural  accelerators.  Although,  it  isnot clear from the documentation of these cameras what is theeffect of these neural accelerators on performance metrics suchas latency and throughput. To systematically benchmark thesemachine  vision  cameras,  we  propose  a  parameterized  modelgenerator  that  generates  end  to  end  models  of  ConvolutionalNeural   Networks(CNN).   Using   these   generated   models   webenchmark   latency   and   throughput   of   two   machine   visioncameras,  JeVois  A33  and  Sipeed  Maix  Bit.  Our  experimentsdemonstrate  that  the  selected  machine  vision  camera  and  thedeep  learning  models  can  robustly  verify  grasp  with  97%  perframe  accuracy.

# Open Source Contributions

## [BayesPy – Bayesian Python](https://www.bayespy.org/)
BayesPy provides tools for Bayesian inference with Python. The user constructs a model as a Bayesian network, observes data and runs posterior inference. The goal is to provide a tool which is efficient, flexible and extendable enough for expert use but also accessible for more casual users.

## [b-it-bots](https://github.com/b-it-bots)
ROS software packages of b-it-bots for different robots.
