# What to learn?

I wanted to develop glossary/Wiki of DNN related topics and my explanation of them so that I can be sure that I know the topics.
But for that I needed a list of relevant topics. DNN is an exponentially exploding field and with low signa to noise ratio.
So it becomes really difficult in *fooling up* with the new work without having a firm understanding of what is firm knowledge.
This selection of topics should help any new commer to be sure that if I know what these topics are then you can claim that you 
know a little about deep learning.


* Deep Learning vs Other Machine Learning Approaches
* The Essential Math of Artificial Neurons
* The Essential Math of Neural Networks
* Activation Functions
* Cost/Loss Functions 
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Backpropagation
* Mini-Batches
* Learning Rate
* Optimizers (e.g., Adam, Nadam)
* Glorot/He Weight Initialization
* Dense Layers
* Softmax Layers
* Dropout
* Data Augmentation
